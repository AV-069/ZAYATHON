About Sentinel-Audit
Sentinel-Audit is an intelligent security "gatekeeper" that protects company databases by watching not just who enters, but what they do once they are inside. Instead of just checking a password, the system asks for a Project ID and a reason for the request, instantly blocking anyone trying to "snoop" into files that don't match their current task.

If an employee needs sensitive info like payroll, the AI handles the approval—if a manager is too busy to respond, the system automatically moves the request to a Team Lead so work doesn't stop. While the employee is looking at the data, the AI silently monitors their behavior, flagging an alert if they stay on a sensitive screen for too long or try to pull too much information at once. By automatically verifying 90% of routine daily tasks, the system saves human auditors hours of work, allowing them to focus only on the high-risk "red flags" caught in real-time.
